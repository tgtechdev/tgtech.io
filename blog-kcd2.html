 <h2 id="backstory">Backstory</h2>
The prequel to kcd2 (or kingdom come deliverance 2) is obviously kcd1, the story in the first game starts off with you playing as a blacksmith’s boy called Henry (voiced by Tom mckay) in a village called Skaltz in 1400s medieval bohemia (or the Czech Republic or Czechia today).
The first few minutes of the game start peacefully with you doing errands for your father and other tasks. After you have completed these tasks you go back to your father to make a sword for the village lord, Sir Radzig kobyla of Skalitz. After the sword is forged the lord of the village comes to the forge with a guest called Istvan toth . after the visit we see smoke in the distance and following we see a colossal force of Hungarian mercenaries known as Cumans led by Markvart von aulitz and overseen by King Sigismund of Luxemburg (Brother to the king of bohemia, king Wenceslas IV and son of former Holy roman emperor king Charles the IV) The army of Cumans then charge at the village toppling the gates and entering the village.
The Cumans then start to kill, plunder and burn Henry's village to the ground. Your father gives you the sword you forged and tells you to run and he goes to find your mother in the chaos. Henry steps out of the inner bailey and views his whole village being burnt to the ground, his neighbours brutally killed and he sees his father with his mother cutting down Cumans one by one fighting like a lion. But then the commander Markvart von aulitz strikes your father down, killing him and the cumans cut your mother down.
This is Henry's turning point in the game from where he becomes a young blacksmiths boy to a fearless warrior. Markvark on his horse then turns his head towards you, you both lock eyes, this wouldn’t be the last time they met. Henry then turns and runs for his life. 

<h2 id="story">Story of KCD2 </h2>
Kingdom Come: Deliverance II continues Henry of Skalitz's story immediately after the first game, set in 1403 Bohemia amidst a civil war. Henry, a blacksmith's son now serving Sir Radzig Kobyla, seeks revenge against Sigismund's forces who destroyed his home and killed his parents. Joined by Sir Hans Capon, he navigates political intrigue and betrayal. His personal quest for vengeance intertwines with efforts to free the imprisoned King Wenceslaus IV. The game explores themes of justice, love, morality, and heroism in a brutal, historically accurate medieval world.

The story starts off with you riding into a new undiscovered region (Trosky) with your lord Sir Hans Capon along with some of Rattay’s garrison and your dog mutt. You ride into the region fully armoured with a horse and continue until you hit a crossroad and a huge band of soldiers wearing Sir otto von bergow’s colours. A tense moment occurs until Henry enters the conversation. This conversation allows the player to choose their starting main stats and teaches you about the dialogue system. Then after the encounter your troop makes camp and this is the first time the game lets you freely walk around. This mini segment teaches you how to swordfight, play dice and the mechanics on how to feed, praise and call your dog. After this there is another strand of dialogue on your skills and then you and sir hans bathe in a pond. This segment is a questionable way of teaching you about stealth and distracting enemies or NPCs in stealth. Later you see a band of bandits ferociously tear through your brothers in arms quickly with their leader in the background on his horse with his visor down to hide his face to the player keeping him a mystery to the player.

We catch a glimpse of a very familiar character but only for a second. Sir hans and henry flee the camp through the lake. They get to the other side with Henry being struck by an arrow and then fleeing through the rocks. They avoid bandit patrols and go to the cliff. Hans makes it through a gap but  Henry is stopped by a bandit but Henry still disarms him and they fight. No matter if the player wins the fight or loses it. A cutscene plays with the bandit and henry falling of the cliff. The game cuts to a hillside where Henry is sitting down, his father or stepfather appears (However you view it). Martin tells Henry that he is not dead and he tells him to not give up and to never give up. It then cuts to hans telling henry to wake up. The bandit broke henrys fall but all of his stats have significantly decreased. Hans helps Henry walk through the forest but Henry heavily hallucinates and sees his family, lover and his village being burned and killed. They then arrive at a herbwomans hut where they rest up and heal. Henry wakes up and hans was attacked by a bandit in the night and you meet the herbwoman bozehna. She gives henry a shirt and food. This segment is slow and boring. It teaches you to pick herbs and brew potions. The next day hans is significantly better and you meet him outside with the herbwoman and her daughter and they talk. After that a cutscene plays with Hans and Henry merrily walking through the woods on the way to Trosky. This is the title card for the game. They pass through fields, farms and a village. At the gate of Trosky Hans gets a bucket of manure poured on him and Henry and Hans get sent away because they look like a pair of beggars. They then go to the tavern in a nearby village called Troskowitz. There Henry and Sir Hans arrive at the tavern (pub/bar). They try to order something but they don't have enough money so they have to work off their debt. But when Sir Hans is confronted with this task he said he cannot carry sacks because of his noble status even though he looks like a beggar and same with henry, because of the three states of man (Bellatores= knights, nobility, kings etc. oratores= priests, bishops, monks. And Laboratores= farmers, common people, traders.). And because of his position he could not carry sacks of flour. So Henry does it anyway without him and after a few times off lugging them around Sir Hans eventually gets in an argument and starts a fight until the guards stop it and then Hans punches the guard which gets Henry and Sir Hans thrown in the pillory for a day. And after a crowd of people come up and throw rotten fruit at the both of them. A while later the two of them can either have (up to the players choice) a huge argument or just a one sided argument with Sir Hans throwing insults at Henry without him coming back at him. The game then skips to the next day when they get released but  Sir Hans ditches Henry and leaves him on his own. Finally after all this time you are given an open world to explore, quests to do, treasures to find and gear to loot or borrow off an npc (permanently).


<h2 id="openworld"> Open World Experience </h2>

 After getting released, it's up to the player what to do. But a tip, talk to the woman shouting Henry's name for some speech XP, money, lockpicks, interesting locations and a quest with a strongman called Tomcat who can teach you a master strike (or meisterhau) one of the most overpowered techniques with a sword and only with longsword or shortsword and hunting sword. There are two main quests you can do but I recommend doing them both . They teach you blacksmithing and the other one teaches you stealth and thievery. Then  it doesn't matter too much what you do to get to the next main quest so do whatever you want. The next quest is the semine wedding where you can dance, drink and do small activities like a dice tournament or a dueling tournament. Interact with characters you met doing side quests in the open world. Like the gamekeeper vostatek, or following his questline will lead you to find Sir Hans poaching in the woods. After a while lord von bergow doesn't show up and henry says his goodbyes but one thing leads to another and he gets into a drunken brawl with half the people at the wedding with sir hans. 

<h3>Trosky</h3>
After the fight, they are thrown into the Trosky dungeon. Hans is sent to the gallows for poaching, even though he is a noble. And the guards at Trosky don't know it (Yet). Henry helps Hans get off of the gallows and lord von bergow arrives on horseback injured. The game then cuts to Henry in an entirely different outfit standing near the railing of a balcony type thing next to Hans in his regular gold and red noble attire. They  then meet with Otto von bergow and his chamberlain who bear in mind, just tried to hang Hans. While you're talking with him you'll find out the same bandits you were at the start of the game attacked him. Henry and Hans decide to offer the lord some help by helping him with these bandits. He gives them both a room at the castle fitting both of their stations. After the chamberlain gives you a tour of the castle but before he can even get out of the room Hans goes off on him like a bomb and goes on a rant for one minute about how the chamberlain should say more than sorry after he almost had him hanged. After, Hans storms off and the chamberlain gives you a brief tour of the castle. You are given a bed and chest with your gear in it. After this point you are able to start the ‘Brushes with death’ dlc. But more about that later. You then accompany Hans on a trip to lord Nebak, owner of Nebakov fortress. Once you arrive things are quite suspicious. The lord owns a whopping 15 horses which at the time was a lot of horses even for a noble. After that you can investigate the castle. You can find Henry's chestplate, a lord of lipa shield, Henry’s saddle from the start of the game and The real lord Nebak! Locked in the dungeon. Or you can ignore all of these and have a duel, chat up a girl or play some dice. After you can tell Hans about the things you found back at Trosky. You talk to lord otto and interrogate a prisoner that ambushed lord Otto and his men. You find out that their base is at Nebakov, their leader is called jan, Istavan toth is with them and the groom from the wedding sir olda semine is with them. You can either tell sir otto about semine or not. Not telling him will give you an achievement. If you tell sir otto you will have to burn Semine to the ground either sparing the young lord and old lord or kill everyone in the fortress. This is the first morality test in the game. These will have repercussions at game's end. You then go back to Sir Otto and tell him what happened. He will then muster his allies and host a party the day before riding to Nebakov. This is another little party segment with tasks and two optional minor romances. The day after you ride out with sir hans and the company of soldiers. Then a cutscene plays out where you see the company riding past the stocks Henry and Hans were in at the very start of the game. Showing they've come far from where they were. They then ride though the woods with their heads held high, things are finally looking up until they get ambushed by the bandits in the woods….

<h3>Nebakov</h3> 
Henry and Hans fight their way through the woods trying to survive having small skirmishes along the way. They reach a mill just outside the woods. They are in the clear until  Hans is struck on the head with a sword from a bandit. Of course Henry cuts the bandit down right after. They are surrounded by a group of bandits with Crossbows pointed at them. Until the leader emerges from the group. And lifts up his visor. One of the most influential Czech generals in history and a national hero, Jan Zizka. Of course he is not as well known now because the hussite wars didn't start until 1419 and this game is set in 1403. Henry and Zizka end up having a duel but Zizka takes his helmet off to show his bravery and confidence. Until this act ends up giving him a huge scar across his eye from Henry's sword. He ends up sparing the duo and imprisons them in Fort Nebakov. Then we cut to a different character entirely who will be familiar to players from the first game, The parish priest of Uzhitz Father Godwin. Or a former parish priest. He was sent to track down by Sir Hanush, Hans' uncle and Sir Radzig Kobyla, Henry's biological father. He sits in the Zelehov tavern talking to the innkeeper asking questions about them, eventually leading him to the place where the ambush took place. It was a path of endless bodies. This eventually led him to a group of men burning some corpses in a hole. The general of this group is called Eric, they have a chat for a bit until Godwin mentions a noble and his page, and Eric knows of a page and a noble they imprisoned and they ride up to the fort to meet the leader of the troop. The leader now with a bandage across his eye, meets Godwin; they talk for a bit until the word ransom is mentioned. Godwin says there will be no ransom and the leader refuses to release them. Then a revolt strikes the fort and a smaller group of bandits attack the fort so the leader agrees that if he helped them defeat the enemy he will release Henry and Hans. Right after we see the duo get thrown in the dungeon by jan, then a familiar face enters, Istvan toth, the traitor who stole Henry’s adoptive fathers sword. Henry reveals istvan as a spy for Sigismund, so Jan throws him in the jail opposite the two. And the rest of this bit is quite long so ill summaries it, Istvan gets set free by his lover Erick, Jan is on the side of king wencesaus, the morning after Istvan returns with Sir otto and Markvart von aulitz accompanied by the Prague militia they destroy the fort and take Godwin, Henry and Hans and Jan Zizka captive, Sir Otto takes hans to a fort near Kuttenberg, Jan and Henry are tortured, a spy named Katherine frees them and then Henry meets Istvan in the highest room in Trosky, a thunderstorm in the background sets the scene  someone is dying tonight. You can either talk with Istvan before you duel him, just duel him or just stab him in the gut with a dagger either way Henry throws him out of the window and he falls all the way down. Some of Henry's revenge is satisfied but no matter, Henry picks up his fathers sword, the one he lost so long ago, he feels complete but there's still one more, Markvart von aulitz, his parents' killer. After this is way too much to cover so i’ll shorten it. Henry gets his revenge, and helps free the rightful king and potentially find love for Henry.
Gameplay
The gameplay for Kcd2 is much more refined than the first game and it is very unique. Most of the gameplay such as horse riding, walking/ running and dialogue is quite simple and straightforward (But some of it is unique). The real challenge most players face is the combat and merchant system. The combat system is different for every weapon type. Eg. Swords, heavy weapons and polearms. The closest resemblance of this combat type is used in the game For honour. Using a sort of wheel type action of which way to hit your enemy from (this is better presented than described). The merchant system is a whole other thing. Again this is better presented than described. But dialogue can also be unique as well, say if you don't have a high enough level in a certain trait (Eg. speech, strength,stealth,blacksmith or charisma.) Some unique dialogue can be missed, that can sometimes make the game or the mission you're doing easier for you. And following along with dialogue, The way you dress impacts dialogue. Say if your clothes have mud and dirt on them, your positive stats will go down (Eg. charisma or might.), but other negative or perks might increase (Eg. dread.). And say if you're fully clad in plate armour, your might will increase, if you're dressed more fancily or poshly your charisma will increase. But this goes for both plate armour or noble clothing as well as might.     

<h2 id="visualaudio">Visuals & Audio</h2>
<h3>Audio</h3>
The audio for Kcd2 is some of the most immersive and entertaining and catchy audio of recent gaming history that I have experienced. And depending on the situation you're in and where you are, the music will change. Say if you are at a party or tavern the music will change to a more suitable theme or if you're in a fight. Jan Valta who directed the music and score for Kcd2 did a phenomenal job with it. And by the end of the game the music just feels different, like it just makes the scene your in 10 times better. Like when you meet Markvart von aulitz the commander who destroyed Henry's village and killed his father. The score makes the scene just so great and dramatic. And a while after that when you lead an army to save your allies in Suchdol fort. When Sir Radzig gives a speech to increase the spirits of the troops, it is just absolutely spectacular.

<h3>Visuals</h3>
The visuals for Kcd2 are really immersive and well done. Well done examples of this are when you first arrive in the Trosky region at the pond it feels like you are actually there, and also the art in this game is very much underlooked and unappreciated. Because when you learn about something or discover a new location, part of it will be put in the codex provided with information below it about what you have learned or discovered (E.G. Swordmaking, or kuttenberg.). And it gives information on important characters like Sir Hans or Sir Radzig or even King Sigismund.

<h2 id="whoisitfor">who is it for?</h2>
I think that people that would like kcd2 are obviously RPG players but also players who like unique and fun games. 

<h2 id="#gamedifficulty">Is the game hard?</h2>
Well, yes and no. Because if say this is your first ever time with this type of game or any game at all it will be pretty challenging, but if you've played the first game till the end (which i 
did) or if you've had so many playthroughs the controls have become second nature (That I have done as well). But at the end of the day not everyone is the same so don't expect to be good at it just play how you want to play this is just my experience. But I do have one tip for first time players of Kcd2, Do not rush it. Take your time to go and do side quests or activities, or look for good armor or weapons, because you will definitely have a much better experience if you do take your time and don't rush the story. 


<h2 id="verdict">Verdict</h2>
Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is a must-play for RPG enthusiasts and anyone seeking a truly unique and engaging gaming experience. With its deeply immersive world, captivating narrative that seamlessly continues Henry's journey, and highly refined, challenging combat, KCD2 offers an unparalleled adventure. The historically accurate setting, combined with stunning visuals and an exceptionally immersive audio score, brings 15th-century Bohemia to life in a way few games achieve. While it presents a learning curve, particularly for newcomers, the richness of its gameplay, from the intricate merchant system to impactful dialogue choices, rewards patience and exploration. For those willing to take their time and fully embrace its depth, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II delivers a spectacular and unforgettable journey. I give it a solid 9 out of 10. There’s definitely room for improvement. So like a few bug fixes and Dlc’s need to be added for it to be a 10 out of 10 but it is very close. But don't forget this is all my opinion and everyone has a different experience. But I highly recommend everyone to play this game if you have any free time on your hands.
